## Story idea 1

**Are Indigenous reservations disproportionatelly effected by Coronavirus**

A story published last week showed that more people died on the Navajo reservation than in the whole of New Mexico, even though New Mexico
has 13 times more people than The Navajo Nation. In my story I would explore the percentage of cases across the reservations in a state,
and a number of cases reported inside of the state as a whole. I expect to find that this is a recurring problem because of the Indigenous
people's lack of access to health services and the lack of means alocated to IHS.


### Example 1

In the following [story](https://www.rollcall.com/2018/03/05/the-never-ending-crisis-at-the-indian-health-service/) Rollcall explores 
the slow incline of IHS in the past years. 

**The central insight:** 3

The reporter made it seem as if the agency was doing worse than before, when in fact it has been doing better, it's just that the
increase in funding has not been radical enough.

**Data navigation:** 3

The data and graphs should've been shown earlier. It would've made the piece more enagging. The data is clear, yet it includes some
graphs which don't contribute to the point the article is making and are taking away from the more relevant graphs. Adding animation
to the graphs would make the article much more engaging.

**Accuracy:** 5

The data came from IHS, and I believe it would've been hard to get it from anyone else. 

**Quality:** 4

The graphs were decent but they failed to draw to a bigger image. At no point were the results of the graph combined to show something
new, or missed by IHS.

**Type:** 4

The type used is condesned and mimicks the style of the type used in the article. Usage of **bold** in the first graph is a bit too
aggressive for the eyes and using a different shade of gray would possibly make it better.

**Color:** 2

There was no reason whatsoever to use purple. It's too aggressive against the white and it doesn't reffer to health in any way. Green is
often used for health services because it's calming, blue because it covays security, red is the color of the red cross and some other
health/charity services and the color of IHS website is murky green. The person in the video above was using a shade of gray so even just
copying that shade for the aesthetic purposes whould've worked better. Two points for the use of gray, since it convays the status quo.

**Creativity:** 2

Again, adding animation to the graphs or making them more engaging would make the whole piece pop-up more. There is a lot of more
interesting ways to show this data. The graphs used were boring and burried in the text.
